# Masked - Real-Time Face Mask Detection
Masked is a real-time face covering and mask detection system that ensures that masks and facial coverings are being worn at all times. Masked uses an array of cameras (if available) and machine learning models to instantly detect if an individual is not wearing a mask. Within milliseconds, the individual is notified and reminds all citizens to respect mask and facial covering policies and laws. As a result, businesses and public locations, as well as everyday citizens, are able to live safely knowing that everyone is masked.
